# HTML Navigation Menu with Keyboard Navigation
This is a simple HTML navigation menu with keyboard navigation enabled. It includes three menu items - Home, Contact, and About.

# How to use
Press the right arrow key to move to the next menu item
Press the left arrow key to move to the previous menu item
Press Enter to navigate to the selected menu item's link
# How it works
The program uses JavaScript to add keyboard navigation functionality to the navigation menu. It listens for keydown events and handles the arrow keys and Enter key accordingly.
When a menu item is selected, it is highlighted with a blueviolet background and white text. Additionally, a sine wave oscillator is used to play a sound to give feedback to the user.
